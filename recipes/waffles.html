    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>The crispier and more texturally complex cousin to the pancake, the noble waffle
        has been a staple of the breakfast table for just as long. Coupled with a pat of butter
        sweet maple syrup, the crsipy exterior and fluffy interior of a fresh waffle are had to match.
        Toss out those freezer burned waffles, get yourself a waffle maker and take your breakfast 
        to the next level.
