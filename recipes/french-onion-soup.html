        <h2>Description</h2>
        <br>
        <p>French Onion Soup is a classic by any definition. This soup is packed
            full of the flavours of caramelized onion, rich beef stock, crispy baguette,
            and topped with gooey cheese. A great French onion soup is not difficult to make
            but the one thing you do need is time. But this classic of French cookery 
            is more than worth it.
